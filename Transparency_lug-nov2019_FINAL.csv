Congrats to Laura Kövesi on securing the support of #COREPER - clearing the way to become Europe's first Chief Prosecutor. Her integrity and experience will be much needed in fighting #corruption and #fraud related to #EUfunds. #Hungary’s refusal to join EPPO: admission of guilt.
Some point out that none of the EU top jobs went to an Eastern European candidate. Well here is a suggestion: the Council should finally agree to appoint corruption fighter Laura #Kövesi as head of the EU Public Prosecutors office.
