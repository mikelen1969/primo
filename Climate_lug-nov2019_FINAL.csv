This is @jonathangaventa, here in Cavendish Square to livetweet the London Climate Frontiers Forum - the signature @e3g event of #LDNClimateAction week that will explore the issues at the edge of global climate politics https://t.co/Sdqq76Scgu;
London has an enormous concentration of creative minds working on climate. #LCAW2019 has been about connecting them up to generate new ideas and collaborations.  London Climate Frontiers Forum will highlight some of the biggest new issues emerging from the week https://t.co/cYaJ6gQRg2;
.@e3g CEO @Mabeytweet kicks off by celebrating the extraordinary flood of enthusiasm that greeted London Climate Action Week - over 150 events so far - covering everything from financing a just transition to respond to security risks from sudden changes in the cryosphere https://t.co/o06ih2pRc9;
Up now: @medinagomez from @CIFFchild, @tom_burke_47 and Shane Tomlinson from @e3g discuss how to win national climate politics.  It can't just be the interests of future winners against present-day losers - need to construct broader coalitions for making change happen https://t.co/foopJWdQgi;
Less than 1% of philanthropy goes to climate - climate advocates will never be able to outspend the fossil fuel industry, says @medinagomez.  But if they have the money, climate advocates have the numbers - with millions taking to the streets to demand climate action.;
Winning climate politics isn't (just) about international talks, says Shane Tomlinson.   Success demands 'real economy diplomacy' that changes the nature of the infrastructure built on the ground;
Now up: former UK climate negotiator Pete Betts and @e3g's @jentollmann debate how climate ambition plays out in international diplomacy.  Climate diplomacy no longer only happens through the corridors of the UNFCCC but through a whole range of new networks https://t.co/SSndWDQZ8W;
Democratic space for environmental action is shrinking worldwide. This matters for climate change.  @Mabeytweet @e3g and @Greenpeace's Patricia Lerner discuss worrying changes to the political environment https://t.co/GkDP6oid3A;
The climate community is less active in coalitions to defend civic space than other environmental communities, says Patricia Lerner - stronger engagement from climate activists would be welcome. https://t.co/LWBkIlrF7V;
Just transition is central to find political solutions on climate, argues @KateLLevick @e3g. But it can't be just a slogan: the challenge is mobilising serious financial resources behind it. https://t.co/yQjg22pcKB;
Climate change is the greatest injustice in human history, says @NVJRobins1 @GRI_LSE. But concepts of justice need to be embedded in the solutions to climate change too. #LDNClimateAction https://t.co/Ol0MlwxORd;
The London Climate Frontiers Forum is taking a short break for more ? and to discuss what we've heard so far. Back shortly. #LDNClimateAction https://t.co/WnmQIlM7fR;
The climate crisis fundamentally means we're short on time, says Taylor Dimsdale @e3g. We need to find ways of learning quicker and scaling up faster.  #LDNClimateActionWeek was about creating the space to have those conversations. https://t.co/9nlFGZRjAB;
The climate community has intrinsic motivation - that's a very different context for learning to other communities says Rose Benedicks from @leolearning. We can adjust learning approaches as a result!  #LDNClimateAction https://t.co/jZZgYOUYH1;
So what about the future?  The final London Climate Frontiers Forum session looks at how to build an effective climate cluster in London - and how to take all the energy from #LDNClimateActionWeek forward.  Send us your thoughts! https://t.co/vPPAaIQYZ0;
#LDNClimateActionWeek isn't about London alone, says @Mabeytweet @e3g. It's about making better use of the extraordinary pool of expertise on climate in close geographic proximity. #LDNClimateAction https://t.co/eV3PjRRrvw;
The London Climate Frontiers Forum and #LDNClimateActionWeek conversation continues...  This is @jonathangaventa signing off. Thanks for reading, and normal @e3g tweeting will resume shortly. https://t.co/BzN0kAFwSR;

The North Atlantic Jet Stream, an air current that blows from west to east, is one of the most hotly debated aspects of climate change science https://t.co/GN7u0KKSsg;
Globally, an even bigger threat is the amount of water pouring off the melting ice sheets. The volume of water coming from Greenland in July alone, if spread across an area the size of England, would stand 1.5m deep, said one climate scientist. https://t.co/DiIcHV9tj8 https://t.co/hxIysic3no;
The jet stream is one of the most studied and hotly debated mysteries of climate change. Scientists are racing to understand whether rising temperatures will make it stronger or weaker — which holds big implications for weather patterns and crop yields. https://t.co/DiIcHV9tj8 https://t.co/QCPyMVtegs;
It was not until the 1980s that really good data on the jet stream became available — and a lack of long-term data is part of the reason why it’s hard to tell how it’s been affected by climate change today. https://t.co/DiIcHV9tj8 https://t.co/Bug35PJrnw;
Other scientists predict the opposite could happen: climate change could cause the jet stream to get stronger and move toward the poles — which would bring milder and wetter weather to northern Europe, with more storms coming to the UK. https://t.co/DiIcHV9tj8 https://t.co/1qGhk4xGvS;

How can global warming be kept under control? Turns out, agriculture and the human diet have a lot to do with it. A new report by the UN has highlighted the central role land plays when it comes to climate change. We broke the findings down for you?? https://t.co/Ly1OctD87A https://t.co/VFdUjzSGeg;
Land use accounts for 23% of human greenhouse gas emissions — and as the world warms, land's ability to absorb carbon dioxide could be under threat. The air over land is warming twice as fast as the world average, leading to heat waves and droughts. https://t.co/Ly1OctD87A https://t.co/pfQQ2xDCZ3;
The report estimates that our dietary habits could have a major impact. For instance, if the whole world became vegan, it could cut greenhouse emissions by about 8bn tonnes annually — the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of both the US and India. https://t.co/Ly1OctD87A https://t.co/NIWoCg6R64;

#Resilience has become a buzzword in debates around #security challenges and is a priority for both the #EU and NATO. Our discussion paper puts forward recommendations for building up urban resilience to terrorism as well as climate and cyber resilience. https://t.co/5xw7B9sWH3;
“I think it is both chronologically and geographically removed from people,” says UK Director at the European Climate Foundation and #EYL40 Joss Garman when asked about why #climatechange is so difficult to address. Listen to the full #podcast for more! https://t.co/uvcEIXvQwB https://t.co/QZdH3sCRem;
16-year-old #GretaThunberg can surely be credited with having revived public interest in #climatechange, but is she focusing on the right things? In the latest Frankly Speaking, our Founder Giles Merritt reflects on the direction of her #activism. https://t.co/TEVfysmErr;
"""We have decades of evidence on the correlation between greater gender equality in societies and wider socio-economic progress,"" points out #EYL40 Lindsey Nefesh-Clarke. Gender equality would thus help tackle challenges from hunger to #climatechange to peace &amp; security #FoEDebate https://t.co/2ZdIwkYRgi";
#Climate policy and #space exploration are two topics that are not often lumped together. But in one week, we host a policy dinner where we do just that – and explore how Europe’s space programme may help in the fight against #climatechange. https://t.co/79ggmSRsMq;
It is undeniable that #Greta Thunberg’s activism has revived passion about #climatechange, but is she focusing on the right things? FoE founder Giles Merritt argues that #Europe needs to widen the discussion and radically rethink its development policies. https://t.co/TEVfysmErr;
The growing political involvement among the youth on issues from climate change to inequality means it is time to consider extending the vote to 16-year olds, according to Friends of Europe's Shada Islam. https://t.co/0FtzXmM0hz;
When it comes to weaning ourselves off coal and other fossil fuels, “The EU has a role to play towards ensuring a just transition,” where no on is left behind. Read our publication to learn more about the regional dimension of climate change. https://t.co/9jCkw5KuMO;
?? There is widespread consensus on the need for #climateaction, however the #ecological #transition presents many challenges. Our report addresses the dilemmas that are often overlooked in the conversation surrounding the ecological transition. https://t.co/eHyfqWgRBW;
On 17 October, we gathered over 200 influential figures at our annual high-level State of Europe event. A key takeaway was the need for urgent action against #climatechange. Healthcare, #inequalities, #EU foreign policy were also discussed, among others. https://t.co/FzARpmKwwV;
National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) offer strong potential for bolder #ClimateAction. @EcologicBerlin’s @Matthias_Duwe explains how these plans are not just mere words, but must also offer policy proposals on energy renewables, efficiency and climate #EnergySummit https://t.co/6jWu7GXOyo;
The majority of #EU states are underachieving and are *not* passing the test on #ClimateAction. How can we ensure that NECPs push governments towards taking bolder climate policy? @Matthias_Duwe shared his expertise at the #EnergySummit https://t.co/aSAzpRmFrX;
And that’s a wrap for our #EnergySummit! A huge thanks to all the speakers and participants who joined us today and to the support provided by @eib @EnelGroup @rte_france @EngieGroup @EDFofficiel. Be sure to follow our work on #Climate and #Energy here! https://t.co/mdzW3RI8QM;
Can we use existing gas infrastructure for #GreenGas or do we need to invest in new projects? @bnetza and @CEERenergy’s Annegret Groebel highlights the difficulty for #regulators in implementing ambitious #climate targets. #EnergySummit https://t.co/9t2bbyEapf;
While there is much talk about new #ClimateChange policy,  @bnetza and @CEERenergy’s Annegret Groebel notes that we *already* have a lot to work with. Now it's up to regulators to determine what options are out there to actually reach targets. #EnergySummit https://t.co/IH7rDUsYYe;
How can we revitalise the economy by focusing on #ClimateAction? As participants discuss this at the #EnergySummit, we suggest: 1?? Invest in #ZeroEmission tech 2?? Form partnerships with private enterprise 3?? Rebuild infrastructure to be greener https://t.co/ylhu6udv41;
So, what is the value of the #EU in #ClimateAction? @Boissezon_EDF provides a concrete example, explaining how standardisation can help promote #GreenBonds. #EnergySummit https://t.co/0NZziYRzYA;
What financial investments do we need to scale up #climate ambitions?  @Boissezon_EDF explains how @EDFofficiel launched the #GreenBond to reach new investors and reduce emissions. #EnergySummit https://t.co/macIL4IuzR;
What challenges lie ahead for strong #ClimateAction? @YlaLeena explains obstacles to be overcome: 1? scale of investment, 2? implementation of difficult decisions, and 3? ensuring reforms are #just and fair for all. #EnergySummit https://t.co/sp22fHCekg;
In its failure to appropriately price #carbon at its true societal and environmental cost, #ClimateChange is a by-product of misjudged #economics. As we discuss the role of finance in #ClimateAction, it’s worth revisiting our piece below. https://t.co/ishaNX7Vn0 https://t.co/NBFLX4ocj1;
'@AMcDowell at @FriendsofEurope #EnergySummit: The @EIB to become a Climate Bank will have to double its targets, mobilise the private sector, de-risk projects, develop a pipeline of new projects facilitated by more #carbonpricing and be aware of all geopolitical implications https://t.co/ES2QKAKX1D';
If we want to mitigate the impact of #ClimateChange, there will need to be a shift to new technologies. At our #EnergySummit, @EIB's @AMcDowell explains how the public and private sector will need to fundamentally rethink how we approach our current #energy tech. https://t.co/mt2bndxMr1;
To reach the goals set out in the #ParisAgreement, we have to ensure that all finance is consistent with it. @EIB’s @AMcDowell explains how his organisation chose to divest from #FossilFuels to remain consistent with the Paris targets. #EnergySummit https://t.co/VgrhbKBXrD;

? STARTING NOW ? \|The final session of our #EnergySummit begins! On the agenda: #ClimateAction, #CarbonNeutrality and more with @Boissezon_EDF, @EcologicBerlin’s @Matthias_Duwe, @bnetza and @CEERenergy’s Annegret Groebel, @EIB’s @AMcDowell and Finland’s @YlaLeena! https://t.co/ZvdPl5QDZY;
Is #GreenGas a possible way forward on #ClimateAction? Yes, argues @tractebel's Deputy-CEO Gilles Bourgain. There is potential in rethinking our traditional view of current #energy sources. #EnergySummit https://t.co/kkb6dnObvK;
What are the issues that are serving as obstacles in making progress on a #JustTransition and competitiveness?   @UNEP’s Mark Radka highlights the need for an inclusive approach on #ClimateAction. #EnergySummit https://t.co/wo2o952FuJ;
At the #EnergySummit, @EPPGroup’s @MariaSpyraki highlights the need for much bolder EU #ClimateAction. At the moment, ‘We don’t have the money and we don’t have specific plans for regions in transition.’ A #JustTransition Fund could provide the way forward. https://t.co/vfX7frQ0dS;
The technologies for #ClimateAction are largely there, but government policies are not necessarily in sync with them, warns @UNEP’s Mark Radka. #EnergySummit https://t.co/MDpnOayuR9;
How do we massively reduce #inequalities and massively reduce emissions at the same time? @Change's Stephanie Brancaforte (@expluma) tackles this tricky question head-on at our #EnergySummit https://t.co/OxMO2nd9NU;
?? Our session on #NDCs, #SDGs and #ClimateChange has now come to a close. Another thanks is in order for @CarbonBubble’s Mark Fulton, @EUClimateAction’s Maurio Petriccione, @univgroningen’s Linda Steg and @EnelGroup’s Valentino Rossi for the thrilling discussion! #EnergySummit https://t.co/9iS7KcuEfr;
Mark Fulton points out that emerging economies could overtake traditional powers on the #energy transition and #ClimateAction. India is already walking away from carbon, as it’s simply cheaper to use #renewables. #EnergySummit https://t.co/L5Ll794pHS;
Speaking at our #EnergySummit, @ClimateAction’s Mauro Petriccione points to the potential of the EU’s #SocialFund - this can help in a #JustTransition and help workers adapt to a changing jobs market. https://t.co/x7fa0RTMo3;
"It makes financial sense to invest in #ClimateAction. @EnelGroup's Valentino Rossi notes, ""There are vast markets that need these technologies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere."" Industries that are thinking long-term will see the potential of #green policies. #EnergySummit https://t.co/WWcovErQ7e";
People will stop voting for climate policy if they see it negatively affecting their standards of living. @EUClimateAction’s Petriccione says that is no reason for pessimism - it *is* possible to create #GreenIndustry, clean energy supply and clean mobility. #EnergySummit https://t.co/x4bPaqHPsd;
On #ClimateAction, @EUClimateAction cautions that the cleaning or environment and the elimination emissions should be considered in a much wider social, #political and #economic context. #EnergySummit https://t.co/iSPvkBSC4h;
"Speaking on the adoption of #renewables, @univgronigen’s Linda Steg notes, “We shouldn’t take the current demand as a starting point.” #Energy demand can be moved by many measures; such as technology, increased efficiency or behaviour change #EnergySummit #ClimateAction https://t.co/AILJqDtXQJ";
?? It is in all governments' #economic interest to act on #ClimateChange! @CarbonBubble's Mark Fulton notes that the private sector wants certainty. Companies are not going to move on #climate unless they’re sure governments are also going to act. #EnergySummit https://t.co/vsdXSPtKa4;
?? There are two important factors that can contribute to stronger #ClimateAction: 1? public participation in the policymaking process, but also 2? stronger public trust in policymakers, notes @univgroningen’s Linda Steg at the #EnergySummit https://t.co/58Z786GOwJ;
"With #COP25 now back on the agenda, leaders must ensure they address all aspects of #ClimateAction. How can they tackle such a gargantuan task? In our latest #Climate &amp; Energy paper, we explore the overlooked side of the transition. #EnergySummit https://t.co/NXyHeKseiq";
?? Should we be pessimistic about public opinion on #ClimateChange? No, notes @univgroningen’s Linda Steg. Popular perception of climate denialism is off - only 2?% of the population doesn’t believe it’s happening. Denialism is not the issue. #EnergySummit https://t.co/UsAroVUoUZ;
Opening the #EnergySummit, @CarbonBubble's Mark Fulton cautions that we may only see higher #ClimateAction ambitions in 2025. Yet we can already act NOW  through - 1? technology, 2? diet, 3? finance and 4? policy. https://t.co/dqkw2Lpd5a;

Any questions you want answering about my work as a @nwLibDems MEP contact the team @libdempod. Looking forward to speaking with them!;
Climate change activist, local councillor and now @nwLibDems MEP - going to be interviewing @JaneBrophyLD this afternoon.  What questions do you want us to ask? https://t.co/72wfwFLe1h;
Did you know that air pollution is the second biggest environmental concern for Europeans after climate change? This #EuFactFriday find out why we need to #StopBrexit and work with our European allies to win the fight against air pollution?? https://t.co/49H9RmhedK;
Today we celebrate the youth of our country. My biggest wish for the next generation is that they inherit a country and a world not affected by Brexit and its uncertainties. So together we can tackle #ClimateChange as one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. #youthday;
.@ForgeEuropa saying Brexit is self-indulgent. Not only disastrous for business but also clouding other issues we should be focusing on like climate change! #StopBrexit https://t.co/dI7WpigrbP;
Brazil makes attempts to tackle the Amazon fires after intense pressure from European leaders. It’s the power of the EU that is driving action to protect our planet from the destruction of #ClimateChange. Strong reasons for the UK to Remain #StopBrexit  https://t.co/nnnudS9Nta;
Over the last 15 years the UK has had a central role within the EU, especially when it comes to tackling climate change. Brexit is endangering our progress and especially our future. People want effective climate change policies not Brexit #StopBrexit   https://t.co/XrIqmL6bJA;
2 tremors in a day! It's clear that fracking is not just a threat to the safety and peace of mind of local residents but also to the environment. #Fracking contributes to #ClimateChange through its' processes and as a carbon-based fuel. It must be stopped! https://t.co/MYnD2xiPjR;
Amazing to see @GretaThunberg passionate work and campaigning. I hope she can move the world to take action on climate change by continuing her brave and inspiring commitment to make the planet safe for future generations, starting with addressing the UN https://t.co/AO73JvsyiE;
Join us, @Wilmslow4Europe @CllrSam and 3 of our fantastic, hard-working MEPs:  @JaneBrophyLD @julie4nw @GinaDowdingMEP to see what is being done on our behalf at the European Parliament to combat the climate emergency. It’s free. Thurs 5/9/19. Book here. https://t.co/eevE3EkI8l https://t.co/p2uAq8FWV2;
We're sleepwalking into a climate disaster. Yet, every day we waste time with Brexit. Time to get our priorities sorted, #StopBrexit and tackle climate change. https://t.co/d8Lt84aeuG;
Earlier I attended the Environmental, Public Health and Food Safety committee with my European colleagues. We discussed ways to tackle deforestation and restore the world’s forests. Climate change is a priority and only in a joint effort as EU members we can save the planet. https://t.co/b2dJXXaUyt;
Packed meeting tonight @Wilmslow4Europe @CllrSam   Proud to be on the panel along with MEPs @julie4nw @GinaDowdingMEP speaking about the role of the European Parliament to combat the #climatechange emergency. https://t.co/r53ZVcw34c;
Many thanks to the 3 NW MEPs who spoke In Wilmslow tonight on climate change and for making chairing the meeting a pleasure. https://t.co/AyM1gw8arP;
Rapid emission rises of SF6 (used in the electrical industry) is alarming as #ClimateChange accelerates. SF6 is so potent it’s 23,500 times more warming than CO2.  I call on the EU to review and ban SF6 as soon as possible and for alternatives to be found. https://t.co/6WS0Z2cV9q;
Pleased to take part in @GreenLibDems International Sustainability event. I spoke of progress #LibDems in @Europarl_EN have made in stopping #Mercosur from being ratified without binding, permanent commitments from Brazil to stop #AmazonFires. #LDConf #ClimateAction @LibDemMEPs https://t.co/T0dix4FDOv;
New report examines the effects of climate change on the health and wellbeing of the UK's population and analyses our high dependency on imported fresh food. No deal poses high risks to food security. The govt must publish all information on risks associated with a no-deal Brexit;
Environment has always been number one on my political agenda and one of the reasons why I am so proud to be a Lib Dem is that together we want bold actions on climate change, and we will put it at the centre of decision making. We want Brexit gone to then focus on what matters.;
Delighted to sign-up and support the @EPIntergroup_SD Tackling the climate emergency is a cross party, cross country effort. We need to work together in this fight. #ClimateChange https://t.co/RkEgCrwufu;
Great to see all the amazing action taken worldwide today to raise awareness of the action needed to tackle climate change. The climate emergency is real and we must work together to stop it #ClimateStrike;
Yesterday I had the pleasure to attend @ifawEU 50 years anniversary celebrations, hosted by my colleague @catherinemep  We need to protected animals not only from the despicable black market but also from the climate disruption humans are causing.

Thank you to Rachel Owens and Giulia Bondi from @Global_Witness and  Vanessa Richardson from @EIA_News I forgot to mention @EIA_News yesterday in my tweet. ?? I took a lot from this meeting and will try to tackle the climate emergency in whatever way I can.;
Flood warnings in the North West. Services by Northern Rail have been cancelled or disrupted making it impossibile for commuters to get to work. This will become more common with rising global temperatures. We need to focus on climate change now if we want to invert the trend.;
Spoke at the youth-led NGOs about policy making in EU on #ClimateChange. Suggested that it’s the older generation that need the actions of young people to make sure we act now on the #ClimateEmergency Good being part of the discussion with MEP colleagues including @MartinChelt https://t.co/g0m84cPrfV;
I also asked how we can shift the debate on the #climatechange so it moves away from being an environmental issue and spreads into the debates on broader topics including Social Justice, Inequality, Poverty, industry, economics, finance, food, health, education and transport.;
Great to see many MEPs getting involved in youth climate action. Special thanks to @ScottMEPLondon, @JaneBrophyLD, @MartinChelt and @alexforeurope for continuing to actively represent the UK at the European level! ???? https://t.co/vIpuajvxaP;

Today the @Europarl_EN passed a resolution ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference @COP25CL Whilst I supported an even higher reduction target of 65% I’m still proud that the @Europarl_EN voted for a 55% reduction in domestic GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.;
Today in the @Europarl_EN we have made history by deciding with a vast majority to declare a #ClimateEmergency. This is a step in the right direction. #ClimateChange will finally get the serious attention it deserves and we can work to save the planet @GreenLibDems @RenewEurope;
Boris Johnson doesn't have the nerve to take part in a debate on climate change with  other leaders.  And now THEY are the ones on the attack against Channel 4 for using an empty chair.  How audacious and hypocritical.  You have to be in it to win it!  https://t.co/6ZyptgZ78S;
Yesterday, 429 MEPs from 28 countries declared a #ClimateEmergency in the @Europarl_EN. In the UK, the current PM didn’t even consider it necessary to show up to explain his plans on #ClimateChange to the public. Our country continues to be on the wrong side of history!;

The Tory Party has no plan whatsoever on climate change, in fact they will probably use Trump’s tactic and call it a “hoax”. It’s a critical time for our country and for the planet, we must vote for someone who at least realises that. #ClimateEmergency   https://t.co/Br0LWUbPVM;

Quote of the day from the London Climate Frontiers Forum;
Looks like the Candidate for Commission President @vonderleyen is picking the EU NDC fight.  She promised 50% cuts by 2030, in a climate law, in her first 100 days.   Greens wanted 55%. Good enough for their support?  As usual there is a confusion between CO2 and GHG though ?????. https://t.co/VXGQNeK30i;
The European Commission's baseline scenario is for 46-48% GHG cuts by 2030 as a result of current policies.  50% implies some new effort, but it's not particularly stretching. The European Parliament has previously backed 55%.;

The @IEA is often critiqued for not having a 1.5°C scenario, in #WEO19 they come a step closer.

What would a climate emergency for entire EU mean? A net-zero target is on the table and a final push in December is needed to adopt it. Would this political gesture convince the money-minded Poles, Hungarians and Czechs? Doubtful;
It could lock @vonderleyen’s green plans in, show the Commission that the EP will not let up and will be watching  But EP pressure can only do so much. MEPs backed a 55% 2030 emissions target a while ago but the Comm is still only talking about 50%;
This is incorrect. The motion passed at conference committed to working on a path towards net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Our manifesto will set out that path. https://t.co/1hFxNnmprt;
Shipping emissions were very high in 2008, but dropped a lot during the global economic downturn.
