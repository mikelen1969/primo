Huge potential for greater flexibility in the EU energy system, with new technologies such as #CCS and #hydrogen shaping future infrastructure needs. https://t.co/xosdRvMB4z
"“#EU indigenous production of #natgas still plays an important role to guarantee #energysecurity in Europe. The #EU needs to put in place policies incentivising E&amp;P activities”, says @C_Schwarck at @ENTSOG TYNDP 2020 https://t.co/RslSk0R5QM"
NEW: GOP @RepDanCrenshaw just introduced a bipartisan bill that would require DOE to establish a carbon capture research program for gas plants. It's the House version of the LEADING Act, passed by the Senate ENR Committee this week. Democrat @RepCuellar is also on the bill
#CCS policy update 2: There's also a Govt consultation on approaches to encourage reuse of existing oil and gas pipes and offshore platforms for CCS. @BritGeoSurvey @ScotCCS @AcornCCS @ParkinDavid @oilandgasuk https://t.co/kdoAWBgzGw https://t.co/v1QuZ4PCYB

Good to visit #Croatia and speak about the energy priorities of @croatia_eu as they prepare for the EU Presidency #EU2020HR. Croatia well placed to seize opportunities from #natgas, #ccs, #hydrogen. Big investments in CCS already being made by Croatia’s #INA! https://t.co/Jrc7NeHp1d
Great turnout today at the @IOGP_EU-organised #Hydrogen4Europe study launch event, with work over one year to be done by leading researchers at @SINTEFenergy and @IFPENinnovation.   Hydrogen, especially from #natgas with #CCS, can play a major role in the EU #EnergyTransition. https://t.co/lVc5EJt0X1
EU #Gas Package is an opportunity to help build a business case for new gases in the EU transmission system,  e.g #hydrogen and #CO2.  EU Gas Directive should be amended to enable TSOs and DSOs to transport these new gases, using existing market tools. https://t.co/wRces89Jtm
Good @Energy4Europe discussions at #CESEC’s Gas Plenary and working group this morning - with updates on strategic new #gas interconnection projects in the region. These projects will together promote better regional cross-border flows, security of supply and flexibility. https://t.co/v094WjCk7b

Good discussion with governments at @Energy_Charter on major role that #hydrogen can play in #EU and global decarbonisation, and new infrastructure considerations. #H2 can reduce emissions across the heating, power, transport and industry sectors, as well as store #renewables. https://t.co/bS8MzcZ4do
Good piece on the last week’s @IOGP_EU conference on #EastMed #natgas, held in Cyprus. Regional cooperation can facilitate development of new gas resources, and pave the way for important new cross-border #energy infrastructure. https://t.co/gEiREmXtMy https://t.co/rsSv3E3yiE
"""decarbonised natural #gas, using carbon capture and storage (CCS), will be crucial to ramp up #hydrogen production in the short term""  via @EURACTIV https://t.co/gWf33L1Wec"
Why should #hydrogen be seen as an alternative to natural gas? Hydrogen production from natural gas is already very common. The challenge is rather to integrate new #CCS and #CCU technologies and infrastructure into the hydrogen value chain https://t.co/kxSkYtDZxr
The @FSR_Energy - @IOGP_EU workshop on ‘Challenges for the Gas Sector on the Way to a Low Carbon Society’ kicks off in Florence. Looking forward in particular to a good discussion on #hydrogen and #CCS #CCU https://t.co/hEZCFTrwAs
Timmermans: “Hydrogen could be applied using a lot of infrastructure we already have. Whereas the problem we will have with solar and wind is that…for this to work we need networks, we need the grids. And there we have a shortcoming.”
More than £15bn to be spent on decommissioning North Sea oil and gas platforms https://t.co/UbwgPRRQQX https://t.co/5bY7HHQCRq
#CCS enables large-scale deployment of #hydrogen: “For households this could mean heating our homes with hydrogen rather than natural gas. For transport, it means trucks, buses, vans, ferries and trains running on hydrogen, removing both CO2 and particulates from our air.”
Good strategic overview of challenges and opportunities of #EnergyTransition in central and Eastern Europe by Klaus-Dieter Borchardt.  The shift from coal to #natgas to #hydrogen, he said, would deliver on EU decarbonisation objectives - while creating value chains of the future.
Incoming Croatian EU Presidency at @CEEP_energy #CEDE event in Berlaymont @EU_Commission: We will work on the gas package if the documents are put on the table. Looks forward to commissioning of #LNG terminal in Krk island in 2021, with benefits for SOS and regional integration. https://t.co/acJUAfwlA0
Another milestone in the #CCS project in Norway: For the first time, an exploration well is being drilled in the North Sea where the objective is not to find oil or gas but rather to investigate whether the reservoir is suitable for storage of CO?. https://t.co/3olmic4mjx https://t.co/Jys9pjjvuQ
"Important progress towards achieving a cross-border #CCS system in Europe, since this #CO2 storage project is based around open-access to emissions from a range of EU industries.   Subsea skills &amp; infrastructure are a key part of developing the new CCS value chains of the future."

Given that fossil fuel companies already have far more gas and oil in their reserves than is consistent with keeping global warming to 2 degrees C, why do not all UK political parties have as their policy a refusal to grant any more licences to drill for new gas and oil fields?

THREAD \| EU member states will decide the energy policy of the European Investment Bank and whether it phases out #fossilfuels on Thursday.   The #EIB is the largest #MDB - its decision will influence how financial markets respond to #climatechange. https://t.co/F1DZXid11N
Along with other MDBs and Development Finance Institutions, the EIB is working to align with the #ParisAgreement.  In July, the #EIB released its draft energy lending policy, proposing phasing out investment in fossil fuel projects: coal, oil and gas (with some exemptions).
Modelling of scenarios for #climateneutralEU by 2050 is very clear. EU demand for fossil gas must decline steadily until 2050, to a fraction of its current size.   This implies public investment must also change—expansion of EU #fossilgas infrastructure is no longer required.
"Encouragingly, last Friday EU Finance Ministers &gt; welcomed EIB ambition to increase its contribution to #climateaction &amp; enviro sustainability &gt;encouraged MDBs to phase out financing of fossil fuel projects, in particular, those using solid fossil fuels https://t.co/r9Yu6riTAf"

Is the US really “energy independent”? I wrote this about it yesterday https://t.co/J12781i6VM
Quite a few people seem to believe: “Oil production 20m b/d, oil consumption 19.9m b/d, result: happiness. Oil production 20m b/d, oil consumption 20.1m b/d, result: misery.”  It’s not that simple
The US oil production and refining industries are integrated into complex global supply chains. Breaking those up and declaring the US an oil autarky would have huge costs. Something you could do only in the most extreme crisis
There are some good points made in the comments, as usual, including one excellent observation from Philip Verleger: The fact that the US is effectively bisected into two separate fuel markets by the Rockies makes achieving national independence in oil supplies even harder
'@saeverley That’s a good point: it does mean something. But it may not be the meaning that people understand when they hear the words “energy independence”. Which is why it’s worth writing about!'

'@Ed_Crooks This is an abstract concept to a lot of people, but it partly explains, for example, why the economy was able to weather $100+ oil from 2011-2014 so much better than it did in 1980-81.

Saudi Arabia's oil supply disrupted after drone attacks: sources - Reuters  So this is a lot of oil — it comes to pass it is ~5 mln bpd. Not easily made up. #OOTT #OPEC #Houthis #SaudiArabia ?@Rania_ElGamal?  https://t.co/nI236DSRCK

Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount....
As we wait for the oil open, I’m reminded of Andy Hall’s words when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.   Same this time? Or a damp squib? #OOTT https://t.co/fQdtBojZ9M
Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!
Everyone is focused on oil supply this morning, for obvious reasons, but the demand outlook is worth watching, too
As we await the start of another week's trading, it's worth noting that the drone attack constitutes the biggest sudden disruption of global oil supply ever, topping Saddam's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  https://t.co/8RO58PvVPL https://t.co/f0E2d9zQAI
Saudi oil attacks: US intelligence 'shows Iran involved' https://t.co/VBOp7om7YH
It’s true that in b/d terms the Abqaiq attack has caused the largest interruption to oil supplies on record. It’s worth remembering that as a % of the market, there have been several larger ones. And the “worst” disruption is a function of size x time. This has been short. So far
A good chart showing the history of oil supply disruptions, from @JavierBlas and colleagues at Bloomberg https://t.co/AfNKDqOrvv
And as my @WoodMackenzie colleague @WMALHittle points out, there is no way world inventories and spare capacity can cover a 5m-plus b/d supply shortfall for long. Her view: “A geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price”
'@beijingscribe @benedictevans @JavierBlas ...US shale production is flexible, because the wells are quick to drill and complete. Output has responded to big price shifts after a lag of about nine months. But US oil companies are under pressure to restrain spending and boost profits, so the response may be muted this time'

Agree @Ed_Crooks - the #oil market has seen much bigger disruptions before, in percentage terms.  History's biggest recorded one was the Suez War...no price impact and forgotten because spare capacity was 35% (!) of supply.  @RapidanEnergy #opec https://t.co/19pMG7ivNF https://t.co/v6tRHyOaNB
Why does the US still care about Middle Eastern oil, even though its net oil imports are roughly zero? There’s an excellent explanation in @JasonBordoff’s testimony to the Senate energy committee from last year https://t.co/3x4oRasmz4
“Because oil and refined petroleum products can be freely traded, surging U.S. production and decreasing import dependence does not protect consumers at the pump from global oil price shocks”

But movements in oil prices can still have significant effects on the distribution of real incomes within the US. Higher prices shift spending power away from consumers across the US, to workers and investors in Texas and other oil-producing states. Lower prices do the opposite

'@ajb_powell But given the poor economics of much of the shale industry, a fracking ban would probably boost the profitability of the oil business overall'
"What would a ""fracking ban"" mean for US oil production? For a start, it makes a big difference whether it is a ban only on federal lands, which would be easier to introduce, or a true ban across the country (1/x)"
Then a fracking ban, preventing any new wells from coming into production, could cut about 400,000 b/d from US oil production by the end of the first year. That would have a noticeable impact on world markets. (5/x)
(Footnote: The same calculation for natural gas suggests a fracking ban on federal lands would cut about 3 per cent from US gas production by the end of the first year. (8/7))

Under President Obama, US oil production rose by 72% while gas production rose 23%. A wave of LNG export projects received approvals from the energy department, and the ban on US crude oil exports was lifted. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren oppose most of those developments
"Elizabeth Warren, for example, says that as president she would ""prohibit future fossil fuel exports"", and revoke permits for oil pipelines including Keystone XL, which is not yet built, and Dakota Access which came into service in 2017. https://t.co/KS26KFAgEp"
"As President Trump has found, big changes to the US energy system are easier to talk about than to achieve. He pledged to ""bring back coal""; but US coal production is set to be about 7 per cent lower this year than in 2016. The pledge was a signal of his strategic direction..."
The pledges from Senators Warren and Sanders to ban fracking look similar. Legislation stands little chance, and executive orders and regulations will face legal challenges. But what their plans show is that they want to curb the oil and gas industry. And that is new for the US

Opinion: Following the massive escalation of tensions between the US and Iran after a devastating attack on a Saudi oil refinery, deputy FT editor Roula Khalaf says drones have become central to Middle Eastern geopolitics and argues that both sides must de-escalate.

As the world speeds up the fight against global warming, executives at Shell have proposed prioritising its gas business and focusing on chemicals made without burning oil. Is Shell's initiative leading the industry in a new direction?
In a new article for the Companies of the Future series, the FT analysed the role that Shell is playing driving the gas and oil industry into clean power. The company is investing in low-carbon start-ups and hydrogen electric energy — but is that enough? https://on.ft.com/2nd8FV8

The debate can be boiled down to this: On the one hand, countries like Poland, Czechia and Hungary are asking for more EU funding to back the 2050 target, arguing the transition to coal-free energy is a bigger challenge for them than for other, wealthier, EU countries.
Fair enough, retort Spain and Portugal. But we haven't received any EU funding to manage our own energy transition. So we're not going to foot the bill for yours, thank you very much (especially if you're going to spend that money on gas and nuclear plants).
How will it end? As with all things EU-related, everyone needs to come out as a winner. So do expect Poland to receive a little more money. In return, Europe will receive assurances that this money will be spent chiefly on renewables and energy efficiency, not nuclear or gas.

project, which aims to import fracked gas from the US, flies in the face of the government’s stated aims to decarbonise our energy system.    After putting questions to the European Commission a few days ago, Ciarán Cuffe received confirmation that there has been no carbon footprint assessment of the project. He...

Great news coming out of #Sweden, where a major piece of Liquefied Natural Gas infrastructure has been scrapped. We've no time for #gas as a '#transitionfuel', locking us into 50 years of #FossilFuel use. We need transition to 100% renewables now https://t.co/nIK3rk8FoY
Obviously, this has big implications for Ireland, as the #ShannonLNG terminal, designed to ship in US fracked gas, some of which could have a worse carbon footprint than coal, has endangers any efforts to transition Ireland to clean future.

Well done to my colleague @CiaranCuffe for his work at the #Energy Committee this, showing up the #ShannonLNG project for what it is - a scheme that will lock us into #fossilfuels for decades, with little consideration of the real carbon footprint from importing US #fracked gas.

Green leader Eamon Ryan: I will eat my hat if within the year we have not stopped issuing licences for oil and gas exploration, it won't survive any programme for government negotiations #MacGill19 ??
This is very big news - one of the world's biggest infrastructural funds is saying they'll no longer be giving any money to #fossilfuel related projects. One more argument against wasting any more energy and resources on what will become #strandedassets  #KeepItInTheGround
One more time - There ?? is ?? nothing ?? there ?? There has NEVER been a commercial oil find in Ireland. What we need for energy security is to reduce energy demand, invest big in renewables and storage, incentivise community and microgeneration and support just transition. NOW. https://t.co/0CTKDENBIF
Big news coming from the Taoiseach at the #IPCC conference in New York. The end of oil exploration is to be welcomed, but how much benefit will it be without the same for gas? #KeepItInTheGround https://t.co/IW8cZz43RH
Bit of a Topsy-turvy week,  all things considered: Climate Strike numbers ? Climate case lost ? Phase out of oil extraction ? Continued exploration for gas ? Planning Permission for industrial peat extraction ?
Taoiseach yesterday announced ban on all future oil exploration. Today spokesperson confirms “Existing licences for exploration will remain valid”  That’s all the yellow and lilac areas. https://t.co/vU1IG7OKYe https://t.co/mLjRi12yrJ
'@EastofMotion Well Brendan we've been doing that anyway - we've not actually found any oil of our coast, but continue damaging exploration nonetheless. If we did find oil, we don't get 'first dibs' on it. The only energy security is efficiency and a renewable energy future'
"The @EU_Commission has just included 55 fossil gas projects on its #PCIlist, including mega-pipelines &amp; methane-intensive LNG terminals. Now it’s up to MEPs to act on climate and reject this PCI list full of energy infrastructure dinosaurs. https://t.co/Yv1HJj7jIA https://t.co/TmIQv8tfyl"
It's ultimately about the people - those responsible and those affected. We will all be affected if bad decision-making around filthy fracked gas and fossil fuel continues. I welcome all and any high-profile highlighting of these survival issues. Thank you Cher.

What it does say is that we need to transition away from #fossilfuel subsidies, and towards a complete transition to a fossil fuel free future. That means a massive national retrofit scheme to make our homes comfortable+efficient, providing huge numbers of jobs across the country
instead of spending taxpayers money on imports of fuel from abroad. We can be energy exporters in the new low carbon economy, and we can make Ireland a fairer and more equal place while we do it.

The 2019 World Energy Outlook is released tomorrow morning! It’s like Christmas and New Year’s rolled into one (but with more numbers and facts about energy). #WEO19
"World Energy Outlook 2019 is out now!  It highlights deep disparities in the energy world and the need for rapid &amp; widespread changes to put the world on a path to a secure &amp; sustainable energy future.  Explore the key findings ? https://t.co/itkbdq36Yd  #WEO19"
THREAD  Today we launched World Energy Outlook 2019 #WEO19, our flagship report.   Here are my key takeaways from this exceptional piece of work that provides wide-ranging insights into how today's decisions will shape our energy future.   ? https://t.co/SL5LlbSgXO  1/
"Deep disparities define the energy world, notably the gaps between:  • The calm in oil markets &amp; growing geopolitical tensions • The urgency to tackle climate change &amp; rising emissions • The promise of energy for all &amp; 850m people lacking electricity  3/"
"The global rise of SUVs is challenging efforts to reduce emissions.  If the appetite for heavier &amp; bigger cars continues to grow at a similar pace to the past decade, this would add nearly 2m barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040.  ? https://t.co/PkCN1FmcKd  4/ https://t.co/avqn06BqoA"
"The past century has witnessed multiple transitions to &amp; from different fuels &amp; technologies.  The challenge today is one of scale: global energy use is 10 times higher than in 1919 ... and still growing  ? https://t.co/SL5LlbSgXO  5/ https://t.co/Ar5iTtNv28"
The dramatic growth in recent years of US shale production is set to slow, but the resources exist to maintain high output for many years to come.  This dynamic provides a strong counterweight to efforts to manage oil markets.  6/ https://t.co/saD5yR5v0n
Over the next two decades, developing countries in Asia - led by China - account for half the growth in global gas demand and almost all the increase in trade, mostly in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  ? https://t.co/SL5LlbSgXO  7/ https://t.co/9g6AdhTNa7
"With a rapidly rising population &amp; a major switch away from the traditional use of biomass, Africa is set to emerge as a major source of global growth for solar, wind, oil &amp; natural gas.  8/ https://t.co/5L61plM7ft"
"The global power mix is being reshaped by the growth of solar, wind &amp; natural gas. In 2040, renewables are set to account for nearly half of total electricity generation, based on today's stated policies.  ? https://t.co/PkCN1FmcKd  9/ https://t.co/JytDq3yoxq"
"The rise of wind &amp; solar has major implications, placing electricity at the heart of energy security.  Global power systems' needs for flexibility are set to double by 2040, but today’s market designs may not bring enough investment to meet those needs.  10/ https://t.co/z48DUeQGX7"
"Investment in carbon capture, utilisation &amp; storage (CCUS) will be critical to ensure that the young global coal fleet is in line with climate targets.  Repurposing coal plants to provide flexibility can reduce CO2 &amp; air pollution and help integrate renewables.  11/ https://t.co/aKwwF6IlUR"
"What comes through with crystal clarity in #WEO19 is there is no single or simple way to transform global energy systems.  Many technologies &amp; fuels have a part to play across all sectors of the economy.  For this to happen, we need strong leadership from governments.  12/"

Today’s IEA Oil Market Report shows supply exceeded demand in the first half of 2019, suggesting any re-balancing has moved further into the future. But geopolitical tensions are high in the Middle East Gulf, and the IEA continues to monitor the situation
The oil & gas industry has a great opportunity to slash emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, without hurting its bottom line. The IEA’s new tracking tool gives an unparalleled picture by country & industry of where the emissions are coming from
Our latest analysis examines the role of fuel switching, primarily from coal to natural gas, to reduce CO2 emissions & air pollutants.   Explore the various opportunities, hurdles & limits of fuel switching as a way to address environmental challenges
Switching between unabated consumption of fossil fuels does not provide a long-term answer to climate change. But there can be significant CO2 & air quality benefits, in specific countries, sectors & timeframes, from using less emissions-intensive fuels http://bit.ly/2JJyBPK
In 2018, 42% of all energy-related CO2 emissions came from the power sector.  It is increasingly critical that the power sector deliver the outcomes of the Sustainable Development Scenario for clean energy transitions to be successful
Oil & gas sectors can avoid close to 50% of their methane emissions without hurting the bottom line, our new analysis shows.   Doing so would have same long-term climate benefits as immediately eliminating emissions from over half of all cars on the road http://bit.ly/2Lsg5Pb

New @iea commentaries out from our excellent team working on energy investment. First up, from Mike Waldron and Yoko Nobuoka, on capital allocation in energy transitions: do you sacrifice risk-adjusted returns if you invest in sustainable energy? 1/ https://t.co/JpDc50ehcm
150 policy makers from 33 countries are gathered in South Africa today for the first ever Sub-Saharan Africa edition of @IEA Energy Efficiency Training Week #efficiencyaction #energyefficiency https://t.co/Kv1RLDdTqz
There are some real eye-opening stats in this commentary from @Laura_Cozzi_ and #WEO team on the rise of SUVs and their impact on oil demand, emissions growth, and of course air pollution. https://t.co/WNttGP34lO
First preview of #WEO2019: 200 million SUVs are on road today, up from 35 million in 2010. Over the same period EVs grew to 5 million. The result? Growth in SUVs emissions (and oil demand) was as large as that from planes + trucks.    @ApostolosPetro1  https://t.co/EyEKz9R37q
The share of SUVs in passenger car sales doubled between 2010 and 2018. At this pace, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars.

Offshore Wind Outlook 2019 @iea is out.   Some findings: 1. New offshore wind farms have capacity factors has high as efficient gas plants  2. Global potential in shallow water and near shore (the cheapest and easier) is enough to satisfy global electricity demand
3. If Europe follows a path towards carbon neutrality, offshore wind is set to be n1 source of electricity by 2040 4. China is catching up: in 2018 it installed more than any other country 5. 40% of the work in offshore wind has synergies with oil and gas practices

'@laurimyllyvirta Since then, toward end-2018, China introduced auctions with a subsidy budget cap for PV, enforced regulation enabling long-term contracts at provincial benchmark electricity prices without subsidies and launched auctions for self-consumption distributed solar PV projects.'
'@laurimyllyvirta These policy improvements, plus faster cost declines because of the global supply glut (in part because China’s deployment went from 53 GW in 2017 to 44 GW in 2018 while manufacturing capacity continued to grow), resulted in higher projections for solar PV capacity in WEO 2019.'

India cancels planned construction of coal plants equivalent to all coal burning in the UK because it's much cheaper to use solar instead.  https://t.co/6jH2IGIDlQ
Wow, Germany's power sector CO2 emissions are down nearly 20% in the first-half of 2019. Like in UK, the carbon price is driving coal out of the German system. Unlike in the UK, natural gas hasn't increased much in Germany...wind is the biggest replacement https://t.co/bID6aQrBMJ
New research indicates that the recent spike in Methane emissions is probably due to fracking (mainly in the US).  If true this means fracked gas is about as bad as coal. It's deeply irresponsible to scale up this sector. (It's not even very profitable.) https://t.co/vy46WWdPzh

Today's #energy world is marked by deep disparities, stresses Executive Director of the IEA @IEABirol. These include the disparity between governments' carbon #targets and carbon emissions. #EnergyOutlook https://t.co/9xGcqdCV3m
.@IEABirol: There is no simple or single solution to reach our climate and energy targets. We need all solutions and technologies to reach a sustainable level. #EnergyOutlook #FoEDebate https://t.co/hFMVCosZgU
"Very pleased to present #WEO19 in Brussels @FriendsofEurope event today &amp; great to hear from Director-General for Energy @EU_Commission @JorgensenJuul on how #WEO19 is underpinning their work on a new green deal. All of us @IEA look forward to continued strong collaboration. https://t.co/4JRZMbru0X"
"Shared #Netherlands perspective on #cleanhydrogen in @IEA #CERT together w/ colleagues from @ENERGY &amp; @METI_JPN w/ focus on #RD&amp;D priorities, further innovation key 2 get cost down &amp; scale-up rapidly in next 10 years. #Netherlands uniquely positioned in #EU https://t.co/rsNOue4cw3"
Had a productive brainstorming lunch with experts representing different areas of Energy. Ahead of the start of the new Commission I am working with specialists and DG ENERGY to look into the priority actions and policies for the years ahead. #EUGreenDeal #VdLCommission https://t.co/VvGnaFE8wF
Executive Vice President of the @EU_Commission, @TimmermansEU addressing the @fch_ju #SF2019: “I see a pivotal role for #cleanhydrogen [in the #energytransition] because it is where #Europe is still leading and we should keep leading and extend this lead.” #HydrogenNow https://t.co/nuRwQaVwOC
World Energy Outlook 2019 includes three deep dives into key topics. Explore the findings below:  • Gas infrastructure: https://t.co/Cv1VxG4unK • Offshore wind: https://t.co/ZxKcsefvnt • Africa: https://t.co/nDI86cEesv  #WEO19 https://t.co/8FIC33WhBo
4 key opportunities to scale up #hydrogen: ?? industrial ports ?? gas grids using existing infrastructure to boost #H2 demand ?? transport: fleets, freight and corridors ?? international trade: boost the energy market  @MWorsdorfer from @IEA  #SF2019 https://t.co/Dcy5AwEgi1
Today we were honored to visit the @IEA in #Paris to talk the workforce, #Sustainability #ClimateChange and the role women and underserved groups will play in the #energytransition  — big thanks to @MWorsdorfer and Rebecca Gaghen for hosting. https://t.co/63mvvpzqzk

'@SimonOn5471 @NeilSmyton They aren't building ships at this point and haven't for years? The dry dock was still used for ship repair/refit which they were doing alongside work on wind turbines and oil rigs.   You seem determined to direct antagonism towards me. Knock yourself out. I've things to do.'
'@Cynical_Colin @nornirishfella Very specialised skill sets, Colin. Not always suitable for more generalised engineering.  They did diversify into renewables, oil rigs, and refits from ship building. Ultimately, it's a marine engineering company.'

Wow, Germany's power sector CO2 emissions are down nearly 20% in the first-half of 2019. Like in UK, the carbon price is driving coal out of the German system. Unlike in the UK, natural gas hasn't increased much in Germany...wind is the biggest replacement https://t.co/bID6aQrBMJ

The oil and gas lobbyist on @TodaySOR is basically making my below point. GOOD.  Oh and the current licences are VERY expensive and VERY complicated so it's REALLY important that no one touch them. Dislocating an eyeball here at this.  Scaremongering now over Brexit. Shameless.

Dearest friends in the UK,   do not feel like you have to apologise for what Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage or the Brexit Party have said or done in the last weeks.  Nobody in Europe thinks they are “the UK”.   We know you are there. We admire your energy. Keep going. ??????????
'@ofgem statutory responsibilities must have decarbonisation at their core #ClimateEmergency. Energy regulator is out of touch over climate crisis, say businesses https://t.co/OP7hfjCCZs'
I have argued consistently that the UK has to remain part of the Internal Energy Market. Currently if in an energy crisis the UK would receive energy from our European neighbours. A #NoDeal puts all of this in jeopardy - utterly reckless #NotMyPrimeMinister
#Solar demand in Europe is set to surge by 81% to reach 20.4 GW in 2019 – which would be a new installation record, surpassing 22.5 GW added in 2011 https://t.co/uxpf7YyzY1 #GenerationSolar https://t.co/PB2zofuRSW

"So household waste currently exported to #EU neighbours to be converted into energy could end up in landfill in the North of England &amp; this helps to achieve our Paris targets how?"
Why was this not covered before the referendum? The implications of coming out of the Single Energy Market on daily living are immense. No-deal Brexit 'will see more waste going to landfill' https://t.co/CItYuDMXcA
This island in #Denmark is already 100% #renewable. It produces enough #solar and #wind power not only to provide for its own needs but it sells some to the surrounding islands as well.

Denmark just launched the world's largest all-electric ferry — a vessel that will prevent the release of 2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.  Even if the shipping sector, fossil fuel reduction can be achieved.  https://t.co/UpAQM9Vjyq
From waste being converted to energy by our European neighbours to being sent to landfill - disgraceful
#Fracking must be BANNED! We need a #GreenNewDeal - only @UKLabour  has the ambition to invest in the clean green technologies - Solar, Wind, Tidal etc. Blackpool and the Fylde Coast can become a hub for  #renewables and high skilled green jobs.  @LabGND https://t.co/S8g44sgmJS
The Council is stocking up on liquified petroleum gas to keep our crematorium working if we lose access to gas in the fallout of a no deal Brexit, but trying to stop no deal from happening is “laughable”?...  The DUP really are far out on this one. https://t.co/RwfqAcL0E6

It's a global first - to be followed by other banks!  3 weeks before #COP25, it's a sign we CAN tackle #climatecrisis by working together &amp; pushing hard.  Congrats to all involved! #fossilfreeEIB  https://t.co/QBRr8fcr7v https://t.co/XVZnt6IA8g"
